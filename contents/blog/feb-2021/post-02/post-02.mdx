title: What I Learned Building My First PERN Stack App

A couple of weekends ago, I finally completed and deployed successfully my first PERN Stack app. I followed a freeCodeCamp tutorial on the PERN stack â€” which stands for Postgres Express React & Node â€“ and managed to host on Heroku a simple CRUD Todo app.

Although there were a few issues along the way, especially during deployment, I came out of the tutorial with some new knowledge:

## The structure of the application matters when deploying to Heroku.

Given this was a full stack application Heroku needs access to a package.json file.

## Using Postgres & Heroku for Development and Production

Some behind-the-scenes work takes place with the Heroku Postgres addon, such as the inclusion of a config variable DATABASE_URL that will be used when the app is in production. Speaking of which, I also learned more about using environment variables, including that the NODE_ENV environment variable comes from Express:

```
const pool = new Pool( process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? proConfig : devConfig );
```

I actually went through two tutorials for this basic PERN stack project. The first goes over building the actual project, which was a basic CRUD Todo app. The second follows up with how to deploy to Heroku. Though I tried to follow everything to a T, when I finally deployed my own version to Heroku, I still encountered some issues.

The main errors that came up when my app was hosted on Heroku were:

```
GET https://angie-pern-app-herokuapp.com/todos 503 (Service Unavailable)
```

and

```
Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0
```

These errors, however, were not as helpful as the error I found in the Heroku logs:

```
FATAL:no pg_hba.conf entry for host ....
// shortened for simplicity
```

I can't say for certain, but when setting up my environment variables to connect to the Postgres database, it's highly likely that including a postgres user and password are necessary for the Heroku Postgres addon to work. I say "highly likely" because I initially used a different postgres user, and when I first deployed my app, the Heroku logs hinted at authentication errors.

In lamest terms? Make sure you add in your .env file these environment variables:

1. postgres user that has the necessary permissions for the Heroku addon to work

2. That user's password

Lastly, I also modified the proConfig variable inside my `db.js` file to include the `ssl` key that the freeCodeCamp tutorial did not have:

```
const proConfig = {
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false,
  },
};
```

According to Heroku: "All Heroku Postgres production databases require using SSL connections to ensure that communications between applications and the database remain secure." A little digging into the Heroku docs led me to add the ssl key to my config variable for production, although they seem to advise [not doing it this way](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#heroku-postgres-ssl).

So in the end, I learned a little more about Heroku, especially regarding Node and Postgres, and I had a chance to write more SQL code and see how it is used for a full stack application. I'll need to double-check the right way to deploy to Heroku especially with SSL and other security concerns. But that said, I can't wait to start on my next PERN project!
