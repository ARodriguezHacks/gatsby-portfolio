It goes without saying that 2020 was a difficult year. I had my first developer job and lost it within two months. Learning to code while making ends meet is not impossible, but the amount of insecurity and restlessness can increase to the point of helplessness. Self-confidence wavers, imposter syndrome kicks in everyday. Really the struggle becomes how to find the light at the end of the tunnel.

Despite the tumultuousness, I always try my hardest to prevent myself from complaining. I try not to think of complaining thoughts for fear of succumbing to other negative inactions like moping and playing the victim card.

So instead of lamenting on what could have been or feeling sorry for myself, I want to share a few positives now that we're past the first of month of 2021.

Firstly, I'm progressing well with my learning of the MERN Stack. I'm taking a Udemy course by Brad Traversy in which we build an eCommerce app from the ground up. I've watched and read other tutorials regarding Node and Express, but I couldn't really grasp how a full stack application was put together. It was easier to bypass some of that behind-the-scenes configuration with Ruby on Rails, and even with Create-React-App the configuration is taken care of for us. But it eats away at my consciensce not knowing the inner workings of these behind-the-scenes tools. It's been a lengthy process learning the MERN stack, because when I first started around 10 months ago, I realized I was still shaky with my JavaScript, especially asynchronous JavaScript. So I had to backpedal and review my JavaScript chops.

In addition to the MERN Stack, I've been teaching myself SQL and Python. I just wrapped up a tutorial on the PERN Stack (P for Postgres), and I'm excited to get more familiar with full stack JavaScript web development. I am also feeling more confident with Ruby and Rails. Taking courses from the Pragmatic Studio has greatly improved my understanding of Ruby and the Rails framework. Ruby is a lovely language and I'd hate to forget it. Lastly, I've been getting better at React and its newest features such as Hooks, yet I think what I'm most proud of myself in 2020 is learning and understanding Redux.

And while it has taken me longer than I would like to admit to learn everything I know so far, I've come to accept this as just the way it happened to be. For all my efforts to be perfect and understand everything to a T, I'm as imperfect as can be. Even writing everyday has been a struggle for fear of not writing the most perfect posts. But I think as long as I have inspired or motivated some type of call to action whenever I write, I've accomplished something productive, if not positive.

Happy learning!
