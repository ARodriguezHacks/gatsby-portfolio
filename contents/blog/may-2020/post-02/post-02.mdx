Learning to code through a bootcamp was a great experience, but at the same time, turning to outside resources can really bridge that huge learning curve. In my first post, I mentioned how there were blogs whose content has helped me become a better developer, so in this post I want to acknowledge the various resources—apart from blogs—that I consider great for learning about web development.

## Youtube Channels:

### The Net Ninja

My favorite youtube resource. I love the Net Ninja's tutorials. He explains almost every line of code and also why he codes the way he does. He puts together playlists of various tutorials and I've rewatched some of them while creating more project at the same time. I especially recommend his intro to react and redux playlist.

### Traversy Media

My second favorite channel for learning web development. Plentty of well-put together content, including non-technical content like how to be a better developer.

### Design Course

Great for front end developer tutorials. The videos range from 5 to 40 minutes in length. Very informative, concise, you get a lot of out it, especially if you immediately put what you learn to use.

### freeCodeCamp

Everybody learning web development should know about freeCodeCamp because they are the ultimate free resource for learning software development. I particularly love their youtube channel because they have so many video tutorials for learning almost anything software-related: four hour tutorials that delve into HTML5 or CSS3, machine learning tutorials, python projects, and that's just scratching the surface. I highly recommend subscribing to their channel. They don't disappoint.

## Blogs:

### Tania Rascia

One of the best blogs in my opinion, and one of the main inspirations for starting my own. If you love reading, you'll enjoy Tania's content; she knows how to explain concepts and sometimes you can create basic and stylish projects.

### Dave Ceccedia

Another great blog from a professional developer. His articles can appear lengthy, but they're worth the read. I've definitely benefitted from reading his Redux articles and I really appreciate his taking the time to talk about the details.

### Scotch

I've visited their website only a handful of times, but I think they have great content worth absorbing. When I was learning about promises and async/await, I read a few of their articles in which they used analogies for learning promises.

### Sitepoint

I frequent their website every so often. Sitepoint is almost like my go-to for learning about web development in reading format.

### Digital Ocean

When I was still scratching my head about how and why the DOM was a thing, I found articles on Digital Ocean that helped open my eyes. They have great writers that know how to break things down, including Tania Rascia.

## Podcasts

### Syntax

My favorite podcast for front end development. It's hosted by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinsky. If you don't mind their banter then you'll enjoy it that much more. I especially like this podcast because it helps me stay up to date with tech news.

### Developer Tea

Great for interviews and taking a step back from coding and thinking about web development in a meditative sort of way.

### Coding Blocks

Another great podcast with humor at its core.

## Paid content:

### Frontend Masters

Sometimes, free content can only take you so far, especially if you feel like you could learn more quickly if you had the right tools. If you don't mind paying a monthly subscription of \$40 USD a month, I really recommend the Frontend Masters platform. Top notch content. In fact, thanks to FEM, I put together this website with their introduction to gatsby course. The subscription also includes access to live webinars which you could then watch again in the future.

Quick disclaimer: I am not endorsed by any of these people/platforms. I am not endorsed by anyone, period. I'm simply sharing my favorite resources that I've come to gather in the four years I've been learning to code.

Another disclaimer:

You can find some good content on platforms such as Medium, the freeCodeCamp blog and others. My only gripe with them is that some posts are not well-structured or well-written. After all anyone can write a post and publish it on Medium; that doesn't mean it's any good. Writing is hard, being able to convey a message is hard. The list I put together is not completly exhaustive, but they're resources that have brought me satisfaction and relief whenever I would feel disgruntled at the difficulty of learning to code.
