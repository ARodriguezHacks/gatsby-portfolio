Welcome to my blog!

My name is Angie Rodriguez and I'm a junior web developer. Not every developer chooses to write about code, which is understandable considering our jobs on the daily consist of reading and writing in various programming languages. My goal with this blog is to improve my understanding of tech and share what I learn. In order for me to have understood everything I know up until now, I've read countless Medium articles, Sitepoint posts, Github documentation, the list goes on...; yet I've realized that some of the best content I've benefited from has come from professional developer blogs. They know how to break down concepts that I feel other published content severley lacks. As both an aspiring developer and writer, I want to create content that can help others who struggle with understanding the world of tech, as I myself continue to struggle. Speaking of which, let me introduce myself a bit more:

Originally from California, I currently live in the Pacific Northwest. I've been studying web development since 2016. It wasn't until 2018 when I joined an online bootcamp that I became fully committed to learning tech with the goal of switching careers. Despite plenty of roadblocks, I've managed to graduate from my bootcamp, particpate in a few open-source projects, and I even landed my first job in February 2020. Unfortuantely, due to the present COVID-19 crisis, I was furloughed after only a month. Rather than immediately look for a new job, I decided to revamp my skills, which I continue to do, but also create this new portfolio website.

Thanks for reading this introduction; this site is still a work in progress, but as I continue to work on my skills I also hope to improve this site and its content.
