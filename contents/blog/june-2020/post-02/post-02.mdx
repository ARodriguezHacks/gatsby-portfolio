I've been learning web development on and off for the past three to four years. Needless to say, the journey has been arduous, draining, yet uplifting at the same time. I take pride in knowing I've dedicated a lot of time and effort to learn as much as I currently know and continue learning despite my circumstances.

But it's time to start doing more.

I've decided to start my first [#100daysofcode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), effective today, June 28, 2020. Although I really don't use social media aside from LinkedIn, I'm still committed to posting my progress and what I'm working on for the next 100 days.

The #100daysofcodechallenge has been around for awhile, and in fact I'd been wanting to participate for quite some time. The idea is to commit yourself to code for 100 days straight, for a minimum of one hour per day, and post your progress on social media. Since I only use LinkedIn, this is also an opportunity to improve my content creation skills for LinkedIn. The more activity on LinkedIn, the more I can improve my communication and networking skills. Really, there are a lot of benefits with this #100daysofcodechallenge aside from improving your coding skills, like:

- Improving your understanding of coding/web development concepts by talking or writing about what you've done.
- Connecting with others on a more authentic level
- Becoming a more accountable person overall when you stick to a goal and see it through
- Strengthening your problem solving skills
- Getting help, suggestions, and advice from others

...and tons more!

Ever since I was furloughed from my first junior web developer position in April, I have been watching a lot of videos and tutorials—from JavaScript to the many popular frameworks like Express, Node, and Redux—because I want to become a well-versed full stack developer. During my bootcamp I was taught the Ruby language and the Ruby on Rails framework; while I enjoy Ruby and Rails, I felt like I needed to re-learn some JavaScript, especially advanced topics like Promises and async/await, before being able to understand Node.js and beyond.

And so no two persons' experiences or journeys to become a web developer will ever be identical, and that's ok. To summarize a LinkedIn post I recently liked and commented, "It's ok to be different." I have needed to come comfortable with the thought that it may take me longer to find my next web developer position than it would for others. It's ok if that's the case. As long as I continue to make strides with my current skills and have the projects to prove it, I should continue to have faith that my next role is on the horizon.

Right, back to the [#100daysofcode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). I've been focused on learning different JavaScript frameworks and improving my JavaScript overall so that I can start developing MERN stack apps. So for the #100daysofcodechallenge I will be continuing to work on my current project, a reading list app with React, Redux and Firebase. This app will be a CRUD app in which users will sign in and create reading lists that they can modify. Users will also be able to search for books with a search bar that queries through a database of books with the help of an API.

In addition to this reading list app, I will also work on a bookmarks project with the Ruby on Rails framework, and after I'm finished with the reading app, I'll start a Udemy course by Brad Traversy which teaches how to build MERN stack apps.

¡Hasta la próxima! (Until next time!)

Con cariño,
