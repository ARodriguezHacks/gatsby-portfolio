For the past couple of months I've been splitting my time learning a handful of new technologies and tools. One of these has been Redux, in particular Redux with React. I watched a full playlist by The Net Ninja in which he explains fantasically both React and—to a lesser extent but still a great introduction—Redux. I know that the new addition of React Hooks has probably made Redux not as crucial as before, but I still wanted to learn Redux because I like the idea of having an application's state located in one place (which as they say creates a single source of truth).

I admit that it takes a while to understand how Redux works, but I'm hoping with this app I'm building that I can gain a better appreciation for Redux.

But first of all, let me explain what both React and Redux are.

React is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to create user interfaces through the use of components. React is a front-end library, meaning it doesn't require a database or back-end server. Because of this React is usually paired with other technologies such as Express.js and MongoDB to create a more full-fledged application. React deals with application state through props and state objects in class-based components. Long story short, state can quickly become complicated and easily disorganized the larger a React application becomes.

Enter Redux, another JavaScript library that is a state management system. Redux is meant to solve the issue of application state getting out of hand. Redux is a stand alone npm package that can be used by itself, but is usually paired with other JS frameworks like React or Vue.

That said, the more complicated part about Redux is when you are actually connecting Redux to React. That's why when you work with Redux in a React application you need to install two node packages: `redux` AND `react-redux`.

I'm building a basic reading list app and will use styling from Material-UI. This app will be nothing fancy, it's essentially a CRUD app where users can create a reading list and read, add, update, and delete books from said list. Users will also be able to search for additional books to add with the help of a search form. I will be using a third-party API for the book database, but I am also considering integrating either MongoDB or Firebase in order to create a user authentication feature.

In a future post or posts, I will document how Redux works in my Reading List application and how Redux is working alongside React and other tools to create a functioning application.

Until next time!
