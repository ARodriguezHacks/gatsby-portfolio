This past week I finally accomplished a high priority task I started back in October 2020: building my first MERN full stack application.

I've purchased about 100 Udemy courses, but this course, in which I built my MERN app, was the first one I actually completed and earned a Certificate of Completion.

Why did it take me over 5 months to complete? Well, a couple of reasons:

## I was trying to multitask.

Multitasking sounds like a good idea, but after reading a particular article over the downfalls of multitasking, I had to accept that it really wasn't doing me any favors. With some effort, I decided to reorganize my commitments. That resulted in prioritizing which tasks, projects, and courses I wanted to complete and in what order. After that, it was during mid-January when I became more committed to completing this course and break my multitasking habit.

## I took my time

Before taking the course, I was already comfortable with React and Redux, and I had learned some Express and Node in previous tutorials. I took my time completing the course, however, because it was really important for me to understand how each technology in the MERN stack worked together. I put a lot of effort to understand the code and refused to simply copy and follow what the instructor was doing. The course says it consists 15 hours of content, but in reality it took me closer to 2 months to complete because I wanted to make sure I made sense as much of the code as possible.

## I used a different CSS framework

The course uses Bootstrap for styling, and I found it a great opportunity to customize by using Material UI instead. I was also insistent on having another reason to make sure I understood the code. By using Material UI I encountered bugs and error messages which obligated me to read and analyse the project code. For example, I had to learn how to use React's useRef hook for a particular Material UI component; this made me adjust a bit of code that was causing a small error message. I had never used the useRef hook, so it was a great opportunity to gain some practice.

Despite the longer amount of time it took to finish the course, I learned a highly valuable lesson for future projects:

## Plan Ahead

This was a full stack application, and I realized the importance of creating a logical project structure. From file structure to creating a consistent naming convention, having a pre-organized plan will make working on projects a much more pleasant experience. Why? Because scalability and readability are much easier to accomplish. This was particularly evident when it came to the backend lessons; the instructor at one point decided to split some of the code into smaller and more manageable folders and files, leading to an MVC architecture flow. This was a huge eye opener for me, since I am familiar with MVC thanks to Ruby on Rails, so this course helped me improve my knowledge on MVC architecture.

So what's next? Well, I'm always trying to expand my learning, but I still need to make sure I don't try to multitask too much. Here are my next priorities:

- Start another Udemy course in order to take my Git and Github skills to the next level
- Complete a Ruby on Rails course in which I'm building a simple CRUD project (I am currently halfway through)
- Lastly, I want to reinforce what I learned with this MERN course by starting a new MERN project from scratch.

Thanks for reading, and until next time!
