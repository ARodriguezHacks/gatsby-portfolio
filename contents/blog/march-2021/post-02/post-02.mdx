As March closes in and April is knocking at our door, I wanted to reflect on why I've had a quiet month and hardly did any posting or blogging. The first half of March I was a lot more excited about my goals, posting almost daily on LinkedIn. After finishing my MERN project I stuck to my resolve to start my official job search. That's what I did starting around March 23, which as of this writing is a week ago. Well, I'm already experiencing low points such as depression, anxiety, imposter syndrome. Unfortunately, these are all too familiar feelings.

I graduated from my coding bootcamp almost 2 years ago. Why do I not have a job still? There are many reasons, perhaps, but the biggest reason is my overall lack in confidence. What I mean is confidence in my personal branding. I have confidence in myself to learn a new skill, but when it comes to selling myself I crumble inside. I am a shy, introverted, and reserved person. I like to collaborate, and I like getting to know people, but I've always struggled to relate to others. I think I had been fooling myself into thinking that I actually had more confidence, but really I was feeling envious of others and inferior to them at the same time.

I kept telling myself that I was not a good networker; that was an excuse to not network.

I kept telling myself that asking for help is a sign of weakness; that was an excuse to not ask for help.

I was letting my pride get in thw way; that was just me not admitting my fear.

Within the past week, I've been gathering posts and articles on not just the job search, but how to network effectively. As I've read through all the content, I've been able to identify my weaknesses that prohibit me from advancing as a career professional.

Some of these weaknesses include:

- Being afraid to ask for help
- Being afraid to speak up
- Being afraid that I can't offer anything of value
- Being afraid of not being a good person in general

I realized I'd been plagued with these problems since my adolescent years. I'll be turning 30 this September as I'm searching for my next entry level job. Just writing that out makes my stomach drop and my hands clammy because I should be at least at an associate level. I am not, however, and I know that it is entirely my fault.

And yet, I've decided to continue my streak of turning that negative into a positive. I'm bent on developing a healthy and lifelong networking habit, but first I need to fix my current areas of weakness.

What I've learned so far is that asking for help is not a sign of weakness. I've learned it, yet I haven't put it in to practice.

I've learned that asking for questions maybe will cause some to roll their eyes; despite any efforts on my part to not ask cumbersome and amateur questions, I have to stick up for myself if I care about doing a good job.

I've learned that you won't always be praised for doing a good and thorough job. That's ok, as long as I don't give myself more credit than I deserve.

I've learned that I shouldn't expect much if I'm not offering anything in return. It's important to offer something, anything, of value, and to continue improving on those efforts.

I've learned that people are not to be taken for granted. This should be common sense, but it's easy to slip and dismiss, which I'm guilty of because of my fears of failure. Networking is ineffective if you're not considerate of others. It's good to check in with folks and follow their progress, find ways to help as much as possible. Because you never know when you'll be the one needing help.

A short blog post, but I hope it demonstrates my struggles and intents to become not only a professional software developer, but a better human being. That said I can't wait for April to arrive; a great opportunity for a new mental reset.

Looking forward to April showers and Spring flowers!
